# Project-1 - Crypto Tracker
A collaborative project that primarily focuses on using bootstrap, 2 server side API's, is interactive and responsive. It is a web application that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

The application itself aims to make viewing up to date Crypto Currencies and making informed decisions as an investor or potential investor. It displays the top 10 currencies and the 6 most current news articles on Crypto Currency on the main page. There is the option to append currencies relevant to what the user would like to single out and keep a closer eye on to the favourites page. There are two other pages; News and Crypto Currencies that display more options with greater content.

## Your Task
With your team, you'll conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. You'll also work with agile development methodologies to help you work collaboratively. You'll implement feature and bug fixes using Git branch workflow and pull requests.

You'll write your own user stories and acceptance criteria in GitHub Issues to help your team stay on track with the project. Using GitHub Project to track the status of your project tasks will help you understand the benefits of Kanban boards.

The user story and acceptance criteria will depend on the project that you create, but your project must fulfill the following requirements:
*Use Bootstrap.
**Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
*Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).
*Use at least two server-side APIs Links to an external site..
*Use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.
*Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
*Be responsive.
*Have a polished UI.
*Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).
*Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).
